Final answer: Certainly! Hereâ€™s how we can propose and apply a simple trend-following strategy to NVIDIA stock prices using historical data.

### Trend-Following Strategy

1. **Moving Average Calculation**: We will calculate the moving average of the closing price over a specified window.
2. **Signal Generation**: If the current closing price is above the moving average, we generate a buy signal; if itâ€™s below, we generate a sell signal.

### Example Implementation in Python

First, let's define the necessary functions and then apply them to sample data or real historical stock prices for NVIDIA (NVDA).

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample dummy data for demonstration purposes
data = {
    'Date': pd.date_range(start='2023-01-01', periods=30, freq='D'),
    'Close': [45.2, 46.0, 47.1, 48.2, 49.3, 50.0, 51.1, 52.2, 53.3, 54.4,
              55.5, 56.6, 57.7, 58.8, 60.0, 61.2, 62.4, 63.6, 64.8, 66.0,
              67.2, 68.4, 69.6, 70.8, 72.0, 73.2, 74.4, 75.6, 76.8]
}

nvidia_prices = pd.DataFrame(data)
nvidia_prices.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

def moving_average(data, window):
    return data['Close'].rolling(window=window).mean()

def calculate_trend_following_strategy(prices, ma_window=20):
    """
    Calculate a simple trend-following strategy based on a moving average.
    
    :param prices: DataFrame with 'Date' and 'Close' columns
    :param ma_window: Window for the moving average calculation
    :return: A DataFrame with buy/sell signals ('Strategy')
    """
    # Calculate the moving average
    ma = moving_average(prices, ma_window)
    
    # Create a strategy column to indicate when to buy or sell
    prices['Strategy'] = 0
    
    # Generate buy signal
    prices.loc[prices['Close'] > ma, 'Strategy'] = 1
    
    # Generate sell signal
    prices.loc[prices['Close'] < ma, 'Strategy'] = -1
    
    return prices

# Apply the strategy to the sample data
nvidia_prices_with_strategy = calculate_trend_following_strategy(nvidia_prices)
print(nvidia_prices_with_strategy[['Close', 'Strategy']])

Explanation:

- **Data Preparation**: We created a DataFrame with dummy closing price data for NVIDIA. In practice, you would replace this with actual historical stock prices.
- **Moving Average Calculation**: The `moving_average` function calculates the moving average of the closing prices over a specified window (`ma_window`).
- **Signal Generation**: The `calculate_trend_following_strategy` function generates buy or sell signals based on whether the current closing price is above or below the moving average.

### Output:

The output DataFrame will include columns for the closing prices and strategy signals. A value of 1 in the 'Strategy' column indicates a buy signal, while -1 indicates a sell signal.

If you have access to real historical stock data, simply replace the dummy data with your dataset and run the above code. This will give you practical buy/sell signals based on the moving average 
strategy for NVIDIA (NVDA) or any other stock of interest. 

Would you like to proceed with this example using a more detailed dataset? If so, please provide the historical stock prices, and I can help you further! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

## Usage

### Running

The system supports multiple ways to run and allows combining different parameters as needed:

1. **Basic Run**

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker 301155
```

This will run the system with default parameters, including:

- Analyze 5 news articles by default (num_of_news=5)
- Do not display detailed analysis process (show_reasoning=False)
- Use default initial capital (initial_capital=100,000)

2. **Display Analysis Reasoning Process**

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker 301155 --show-reasoning
```

This will display the analysis process and reasoning results of each agent (Market Data Agent, Technical Analyst, Fundamentals Agent, Sentiment Agent, Risk Manager, Portfolio Manager).

Set Initial Capitalï¼š

- initial_capital: Initial cash amount (optional, default is 100,000)

4. **Customize Number of News Articles and Specific Date Investment Advice**

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker 301157 --show-reasoning --end-date 2024-12-11 --num-of-news 20
```

This will:

- Analyze the latest 20 news articles within the specified date range for sentiment analysis
- start-date and end-date format: YYYY-MM-DD

5. **Backtesting Functionality**

```bash
poetry run python src/backtester.py --ticker 301157 --start-date 2024-12-11 --end-date 2025-01-07 --num-of-news 20
```

The backtesting functionality supports the following parameters:

- ticker: Stock code
- start-date: Backtest start date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- end-date: Backtest end date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- initial-capital: Initial capital (optional, default is 100,000)
- num-of-news: Number of news articles used for sentiment analysis (optional, default is 5, maximum is 100)

### Parameter Description

- --show-reasoning: Display analysis reasoning process (optional, default is false)
- --initial-capital: Initial cash amount (optional, default is 100,000)
- --num-of-news: Number of news articles used for sentiment analysis (optional, default is 5, maximum is 100)
- --start-date: Start date, format YYYY-MM-DD (optional)
- --end-date: End date, format YYYY-MM-DD (optional)
